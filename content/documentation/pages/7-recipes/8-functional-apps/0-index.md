# Functional Applications

With Spring Cloud Stream 3.x adding [functional support](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-stream/current/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#spring-cloud-stream-overview-producing-consuming-messages), you can build `Source`, `Sink`, and `Processor` applications by merely implementing the Java Util's `Supplier`, `Consumer` and `Function` interfaces, respectively.

Spring Cloud Stream also has function composition support, which we show in the [function composition](%currentPath%/feature-guides/streams/function-composition) feature guide.
