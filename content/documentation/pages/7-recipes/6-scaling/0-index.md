# Scaling Data Pipelines

Spring Cloud Data Flow provides a dedicated [Scale API](%currentPath%/feature-guides/streams/scaling/) that is designed for scaling data pipelines. You can use the API to implement scaling characteristics based on application business logic. You can implement an auto-scale controller and reuse it with Kubernetes, Cloud Foundry, or even for local testing purposes.

This section contains recipes that show how to scale applications by using SCDF Shell or by implementing autoscale streaming data pipelines.
